[HH]Ukraine made its choice in favour of U.S.
[QQ]Baku, Fineko/abc.az. Ukrainian revolution achieved its purpose: Ukraine has made “the right choice” in favour of U.S.
[QQ]As soon as the political decision was taken, Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych has made the following announcement at “Inter” channel: “Now we should decide on renewal of our strategic relations with Russia, U.S. and China. Our strategy should be targeted at protection of national interests. Any decisions should meet the national interests”.
[QQ]The choice in favour of EU association is absolutely impossible. Yanukovych commented: “The threats that we could see definitely don’t meet our national interests. That agreement was disadvantageous and dangerous”.
[QQ]At the same time Ukrainian President tries to take over the initiative from the extreme nationalists who in fact rule Ukrainian maidans today: “We don’t want to obey and we will never do it. We will always protect our national interests. In solving all the issues we will first of all take into account the interests of our country”.
[QQ]He immediately cut off the attempts of his Russian and Russian-speaking electorate to get respect for their interests responding that the idea of federalization of Ukraine proposed in the south-western part of the country was not pressing at that moment.
[QQ]“Such crucial decisions must be made without emotions. We should preserve what we have and learn how to reach consensus”, - Yanukovych believes.
[QQ]It’s questionable whether the existing Ukrainian President still has the possibility to reach consensus with anybody and on anything. Anyway, Angela Merkel, German Chancellor, as the true leader of European Union, is ready to hold separate negotiations in Berlin with Yatsenyuk and Klichko, the leaders of official Ukrainian opposition. Russia suspended financing of Ukraine until it makes official political choice. China never started its investments, as it promised previously and U.S. displayed no interest except for unofficial statement of an ordinary official in support of Yatsenyuk.
[QQ]Some Russian analysts expect that spring will change the situation in Ukraine. In their opinion, the seasonal workers (migrants) from Western Ukraine form the driving force and cannon fodder of the recent events: they can stay at maidans in late autumn and winter but in spring and summer they will have to work and earn their living.

[HH]Millikart calls a key reserve of development of cashless payments in Azerbaijan
[QQ]Baku, Fineko/abc.az. Azerbaijan’s third largest processing center owned by Millikart Group LLC has called the main reserve of cashless payments in the country.
[QQ]Millikart Group’s executive director Jalal Orujev has stated that in this regard, first of all it is suggested to increase the number of POS-terminals, use debit cards and attract the individuals not using banking operations. 
[QQ]"Despite the installation of more than 30,000 POS-terminals and measures aimed at promoting cashless payments, the desired effect has not been obtained," Orujev said. 
[QQ]He emphasized that through the processing center it has been issued over 250,000 mainly debit cards, and POS-terminals were installed mainly in Baku and Sumgait. 
[QQ]"In the regions the use of cashless payments is at the minimum level," he added.
[QQ]Orujev also points to a technical difficulty associated with the cost of POS-terminals.
[QQ]"Because of terminal’s cost the small- and medium-size entrepreneurs can not afford them. In this connection, we propose to begin distributing mobile POS-terminals. Another method of solving the problem may be promotion of payment card users by special bonus programs, and providing gift cards (prepaid cards). A special tax break can certainly play an important role in promoting cashless payments. In such case, the economic entities will be interested themselves in non-cash payments," Orujev said. 
[QQ]The issue of tax holidays has not yet found its solution: its benefits, especially for the state budget, are not obvious.
